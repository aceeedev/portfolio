                Hello my name is Andrew and I am a driven computer science and engineering student at Santa Clara University. Confident in my ability to thrive in collaborative environments and excited to learn new skills, I am eager to explore diverse opportunities and industries with a shared emphasis on technology, informing my professional career along the way.
