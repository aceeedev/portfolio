            <p>
                Hello my name is Andrew and I am a driven computer science and engineering student at Santa Clara University. Confident in my ability to thrive in collaborative environments and excited to learn new skills, I am eager to explore diverse opportunities and industries with a shared emphasis on technology, informing my professional career along the way. 
                In my spare time, I’ll be found hiking vast lands, finding hidden indie music, or lost in a book.
